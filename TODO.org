- If the libbsd is not found, fallback to glibc functions
- Use =AC_ARG_WITH= for the user to choose between readline/libedit and no edit.
  - The default configuration should be used and the user can override
    the default with =--with-readline=
- Use the =check= library for testing
- Use =AC_TYPE_INT32_T= to test for =int32_t=.
  - Also use =HAVE_STDINT_H= and =HAVE_INTTYPES_H= to properly extract
    typedefs from the correct library.
